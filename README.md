## Reflection

When writing software, it's important to understand the way data flows in and out of your application. This helps maintainability along with security. The first step when understand how data flows may be writing unit-tests in some teams. By incoporating other software to assist such as Jenkins and the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure a steadfast way to capture bugs introduced with code changes and quickply apply patches when neccessary. 

It is helpful to break down user needs to the lowest level of functionality, eventually leading to code comments or pseudocode that can be turned into tickets to be completeted later. This ensures all customer requirements are understood and implemented in an agreed upon fashion.

I design software as if I'll need to anwer for each line I write. I was taught that during a code review, a merge should only be applied when each new line can be fully and coherently explained. This ensures that any changes introduced with new code has been considered. Unit testing ensures these changes keep the application's behavior consistent.
